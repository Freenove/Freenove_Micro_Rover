Do you want to learn programming or get a robot programmed by yourself?

Currently, Program is developed into the younger age group, and everyone programming is a trend. From Arduino and Raspberry Pi to micro:bit, simple graphical programming makes programming for kids possible. It doesn't matter even though you haven't heard of them. With this product and the tutorial, you can easily complete a multi-functional programming car and experience the fun as a Maker.

Micro:bit is a powerful and simple development board. Even if you've never programmed before, its simple graphical programming interface allows you to master it easily. It doesnâ€™t require any professional programming software; just simply a browser is enough. So, no matter your computer system is Windows, Linux or Mac, they all work. And you can also program it with Python.

It attracts a lot of fans in the world who are keen to exploration, innovation and DIY and have contributed a great number of high-quality open source code, circuit and rich knowledge base, thus helping us realize our own creativity more efficiently by using these free resource. Of course, you can also make contributions to the resource.

And that's why Freenove Micro:Rover emerged. Rover is a programmable car developed by Freenove based on BBC micro:bit. Adopting integrated design, it does not require additional wiring, which makes it easy to use. There are ultrasonic, infrared and photosensitive sensors on it as well as buzzer, RGB LED and other peripherals. Rich hardware resources will help you master more knowledge and skills. You can use your imagination to create more ways to play the robot.

In each learning chapter of this tutorial, we provide program source code with detailed program explanations and burnable binaries, contributed to your understanding of the meaning of each section of program. 

Additionally, if you have any difficulties or questions about this tutorial and the kit, you can always ask us for quick and free technical support.
