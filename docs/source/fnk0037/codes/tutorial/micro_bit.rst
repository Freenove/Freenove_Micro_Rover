Hardware
********************************

It is not required that beginners master this section, but a brief understanding is necessary. However, if you want to be a developer, hardware information will be very helpful. Detailed hardware information about micro:bit can be found here: https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/.

To complete building Rover, we need a brief understanding of GPIO.

GPIO
=================================

GPIO, namely General Purpose Input/output Pins, is an important part of micro:bit for connecting external devices. All sensors and devices on Rover communicate with each other through micro:bit GPIO. The following is the GPIO serial number and function diagram of micro:bit:
