**Here, all projects that do not require additional components have been completed.**

We have also prepared an additional free tutorial. It contains several projects. But they need additional components or modules that are not included in the Rover kit. If you are interested in it, you can find it here:

**View:** https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_Micro_Rover_Extended_Projects

**Download:** https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_Micro_Rover_Extended_Projects/archive/master.zip 

If you do not have these components, you will not be able to complete the next projects.

If you're not interested in extra projects. Never mind. Just leave them alone.

Enjoy your Rover.
